# Cardiac-SA-node-model
Sinoatrial node (SA node) is known for being the natural pacemaker of the heart by generating electrical impulses and is directly related to the heartbeat rate. This project builds and simulate the mathematical model of the SA node from the perspective of the dynamic cell membrane potential changes caused by ion flow.
